### Deployments

This repo is connected to Vercel. By connecting your GitHub repository, whenever you push changes to your main branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application with no configuration needed. When opening pull requests, you'll also have instant previews which allow you to catch deployment errors early and share a preview of your project with team members for feedback.

(This was set up in [Step 6](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database) of the NextJS tutorial.)
